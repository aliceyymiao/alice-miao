This problem set will take a different from the others. To demonstrate your familiarity with React Router, you will build a personal website for yourself as a multi-page react application. It can be pretty bare bones -- we're really just looking for the following:

Create a multi-page react-router application with at least 3 pages
Each page must contain at least one component 
One page must load data (such as a .csv file), and use that data to drive the content (e.g., a list of projects you have worked on).
Use create-react-app to structure your application
Your website must be hosted on a server
