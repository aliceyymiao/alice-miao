            I am an international student from China. This is my third year in Seattle and I just got my Washington State driver's liscense. 
            And then I became really into cars. I love looking at different kinds of cars and hope one day I can buy one of them listed in 
            my interests page.</p>

            Besides cars, I also love my school. I am thankful to be a student at University of Washington major in Informatics. This class
            INFO 340 has taught me a lot of useful skills and managed to make me feel passionate about something.

            Lastly, I'm also a foodie. I love trying different kinds of food and Seattle is just a heaven for a foodie like me.
            There are so many kind of decent food here. One of my favorite is seafood. I've been to a fancy restaurant called Canlis
            in Queen Anne, and it was the best restaurant I've ever tried in my entire life. It was really expensive but the food was
            so good. Those local restaurants make my feel like I am part of the city. I'm able to enjoy the taste of food as well as 
            feeling the vibe of this city.
