            I am an international student from China. This is my third year in Seattle and I just got my Washington State driver's liscense. 
            And then I became really into cars. I love looking at different kinds of cars and hope one day I can buy one of them listed in 
            my interests page.</p>

            Besides cars, I also love my school. I am thankful to be a student at University of Washington major in Informatics. This class
            INFO 340 has taught me a lot of useful skills and managed to make me feel passionate about something.
